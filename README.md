Functional survey form for HR customers of Loop Health. The goal was to replicate the structure of Loop's internal HR dashboard and provide an end-to-end survey flow â€” fast and simple.

Designed and built everything myself: the dashboard interface, the survey form, its questions and answer types, validation logic, and an admin panel for reviewing submissions.
